def dirichlet_likelihood(weights, alpha=None):
	""" Calculate the log likelihood of the observed topic proportions.
	A positive likelihood is more likely than a nedgative likelihood.
	Args:
		weights (chainer.Variable): Unnormalized weight vector. The vector
			will be passed through a softmax function that will map the input
			onto a probability simplex.
		alpha (float): The Dirichlet concentration parameter. Alpha
			greater than 1.0 results in very dense topic weights such
			that each document belongs to many topics. Alpha < 1.0 results
			in sparser topic weights. The default is to set alpha to
			1.0 / n_topics, effectively enforcing the prior belief that a
			document belong to every topics at once.
	Returns:
		~chainer.Variable: Output loss variable.
